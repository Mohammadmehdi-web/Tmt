                            Since independence our country as well as our community has advanced economically, socially and globally but still we are way behind and woefully out of pace with the international progress. 
                            We have transited through the dark period when the majority of people were indifferent towards educating their children. These days everyone desires to get his/her children educated. 
                            Numerous numbers of government and private schools have been established to cater to the growing need. However, the education one gets in these schools, specifically in rural areas, 
                            is way more different in quality aspects. Majority of these schools fail to deliver affordable quality education and as a result children attending such schools are still short of 
                            quality education which has the power to give them the knowledge, skills, and confidence to reach their full potential towards employability which in turn acts as a bulwark against
                            poverty and exploitation. Poor quality of education is not only limited to schools but even institutes offering professional and higher education are also lacking in quality of education
                            and training and as a result students graduating out of such institutes don’t have skills good enough to make them employable.
                        </p>

                          The need of the hour is that all stakeholders in the education sector should work on a blueprint to adopt the following measures to facilitate our students in getting employability driven quality education.

                          We at TMT are trying to work and incorporate these measures in our schools and programs, though we have progressed successfully to a certain level but still we have lot more to achieve towards quality.
                        </p>

                          Its an age-old dictum that “Taaleem” (education) goes hand in hand with “Tarbiyat” (upbringing or grooming). Hence, we need to give equal importance to proper upbringing of our children along with quality education.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="text-justify">
                        <img width="18" height="18" src="https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/arrow.png" alt="arrow"/>
                          Our society is witnessing deterioration in the quality of upbringing and grooming (Tarbiyat) of our children. We usually attribute this serious problem to the busy life of the parents- as they tend to spend less or hardly any time with their children- and growing misuse of social media and changing family structure from joint family to nuclear family.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="text-justify">
                        <img width="18" height="18" src="https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/arrow.png" alt="arrow"/>
                          My personal experience which adds to the list is that parents are evading their prime responsibility by passing it on to the school and its teachers, whereas it’s a joint responsibility in which parents play a major role.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="text-justify">
                        <img width="18" height="18" src="https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/arrow.png" alt="arrow"/>
                          Irrespective of its root causes, parents need to work seriously towards this equally important issue of much needed immaculate upbringings of our children by participating proactively to inculcate high moral, ethical, human and spiritual values in our children so that they may develop character and confidence to evolve into a good human being and socially productive and responsible citizen.
                        </p>

                          Mothers have always played a pivotal role in shaping the future of our children and leaving behind a generation which outshines their predecessor. Hence, we at TMT have also preferred to partner with mothers in all our programs. To strengthen the element of “Tarbiyat” of children we have launched a project called “Tarbiyat”. The objective of the program is to educate, train and motivate mothers towards holistic upbringing of their children. Two years of Covid has pushed the program onto the back burner. We have worked out to launch a pilot project of 'Tarbiyat' again from the new session. Initially we shall be working with mothers from underprivileged families whose children are enrolled in our free education program. Team members visit homes to observe and evaluate the living condition / environment and interact with mothers on one-to-one basis as part of their need assessment exercise. Based on the need analysis they choose topics and organise orientation lectures for these mothers in manageable groups using audio-video aids.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="text-justify">
                        <img width="18" height="18" src="https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/arrow.png" alt="arrow"/>
                          There is no free lunch – successes are achieved by making sacrifices, determination and hard work in the right direction. Preparing a generation of higher calibre is a herculean task, especially for mothers who never got an opportunity to attend schools. But I have a strong conviction that the investment we put jointly into our children and sacrifices we make today by providing “Taaleem with Tarbiyat” will help them to achieve greater heights and create a brighter future irrespective of their socio-economic status.
                        </p>

                          Before I conclude, I, also, wish to use this opportunity to convey my gratitude to all our well wishers, supporters, donors and team members for taking TMT and its projects from one level to another. Whatever has been accomplished is due to grace of The All Merciful and support of our stakeholders but still, we have miles to go, and considerable qualitative and quantitative scaling needs to be achieved by TMT team towards empowering the underprivileged by providing them means for quality education, healthcare and general wellbeing.
