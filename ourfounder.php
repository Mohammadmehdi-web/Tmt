                                Dr. Kalbe Sadiq firmly believed that education is crucial for
                                societal upliftment. He emphasized that education should be
                                accessible to all, irrespective of socio-economic status, and
                                dedicated his life to this cause. On April 18, 1984, he
                                established the
                                <strong>Tauheedul Muslimeen Trust</strong> (TMT) to provide
                                educational scholarships and assistance to underprivileged
                                children. Under his guidance, the trust also initiated
                                programs for medical aid, widow aid, mother and child care,
                                and orphan educational aid, improving countless lives.
